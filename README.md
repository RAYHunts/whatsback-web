Whatsback Provider is a simple WhatsApp provider that offers basic functionality such as predefined static commands, sending messages to contacts or groups, and listing all contacts. This project leverages the unofficial [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) package to interface with WhatsApp Web.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.**

## Features

- **Predefined Static Commands:**  Quickly execute common commands without the need for manual input.
- **Send Message to Contact:**  Programmatically send message directly to individual contacts.
- **Send Message to Group:**  Programmatically send message to the groups.

## Available REST API

You can read the REST API documentation [here](WHATSBACK-API.md)

## Security Considerations

- This project uses middleware like Helmet, express-rate-limit, and hpp to help protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- Be aware that using an unofficial API (whatsapp-web.js) can carry risks with regard to WhatsApp's terms of service.
- Whatsback Web and whatsapp-web.js are not officially supported by WhatsApp. Use this project at your own risk.
- It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.
